## Hemodynamics

This section will cover the hemodynamics (haemodynamics) - it is the study of the blood flow. Using the lumped parameter approach - the hemodynamics is modeled as an analogy of an electrical circuit with a set of resistors, capacitors (elastic vessels), diodes (valves) and inductance (inertial elements) in a closed loop.

The blood vessels are characterized by it's capacity (capacitance), i.e. how much the
