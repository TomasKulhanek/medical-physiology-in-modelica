# Preface

This book is arising continuously. We write it based on our experience and research for the students, researchers and other people interested in mathematical models  of medical physiology. 


We would like to make this book free, but we need to support the first release of this book. Please help us to achieve our goal e.g. via crowdfunding campaign 
* via Indiegogo [igg.me/at/mephysmo](http://igg.me/at/mephysmo)
* via BitcoinUtopia

For formalizing medical physiology we have chosen the Modelica standard language as it is open, provides some key features (object oriented, equation-based, acausal) which seems to best capture the essence of the modeled reality and the standard is open and supported by several tools, so the models can be exported and simulated anywhere. 

While we have chosen the Modelica standard language, the details of general Modelica is covered by excellent published works by Peter Fritzson[^1] and a free online book by Michael Tiller[^2]. This book focus on examples related to medical physiology.

### Who we are?

We are group of scientists, students in the multidisciplinary field of medical physiology, computer science, numerical mathematics, computer designers. Among our duties is to teach students of biomedical engineering the modeling and simulation and to design and develop innovative approach toward Medical Physiology.
Among others, the authors of this book are developing free libraries for Modelica language [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) (1st library award at Modelica conference 2014) and [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical)(1st library award at Modelica conference 2015). 

### Why we need a support?
If we will charge the book, it will be not broadly available for everyone who is interested. The support will give us freedom to fully focus on writing the book from the collected materials we already have. Prior to some innovative grant, we would like to try this way to support the creation of this book.

### Why so big ammount of money?

We need to support several people for several months (4-6) to fully focus on qualitative material preparation.
Writing book, writing/revieweing examples, improving free Modelica libraries (  [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org), [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical)).

### Why a book of modeling medical physiology?

Modelica is not yet widely used technology for modeling biology and physiology. In some cases the Modelica is not us ed with it's strong features. We believe that learning curve of accepting Modelica will compensate productivity and visual plausibility of the models by other domain experts.

### What will be delivered at the end of the project?

We would like to release the book under creative commons licence. So the book will be available free of charge to anybody. We would like to release PDF, ebook and printed version of the book as well, but this will need additional costs, so we do not promise that the additional form of the book will be free. The book will contain many examples, which will encourage us to update and enhance the free libraries  [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) and [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical) too.


### What will be time-frame of the project?

Beta release is planned to be until IEEE Engineering in Biology and Medicine Conference 2016. Final release will be introduced also in Modelica conference in 2017.
