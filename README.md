Preface
=======

This book is being written for the people interested in mathematical models in the field of Medical Physiology. 
We have chosen the current Modelica standard language as it seems to best capture the essence of the modeled reality. However, the examples presented within this book could be implemented with less or more less effort in any other modeling language, however, with limitation based on available features.

While we have chosen the Modelica standard language, the details of general Modelica is covered by excelent published works by Peter Fritzson - "Principles of Object-Oriented Modeling and Simulation with Modelica 3.3: A Cyber-Physical Approach" and a free online book by Michael Tiller "Modelica by Example" available at [book.xogeny.com](http://book.xogeny.com).

The first release of this book is now trying to be supported by a crowdfunding campaign via indiegogo.

### Why we need support?

We are group of scientists, students in the multidisciplinar field of medical physiology, computer science, numerical mathematics, computer designers. Among our duties is to teach students of biomedical engineering the modeling and simulation and to design and develop innovative approach toward Medical Physiology. And writing a book - handbook - is not generally recognized as innovative to be supported by scientific grants. The support will give us freedom to fully focus on writing the book from the collected materials we already have.

### Why so big ammount of money?

We need to support 4-5 people for several months (4-6).  Otherwise we will be asked to write unrelated articles to scientific journal with impact factor, or to work for other scientific groups who fortunately has some scientific grants, but not space for writing a book.

### Why a book of modeling medical physiology?

The Modelica language and standard is a niche in an area of industry modeling and design. Within medical sciences, the models are used to formalize mathematical knowledge. Modelica is not yet widely accepted and there exists several home-grown or community-grown domain specific languages, which in particular fails in integrative approach of modeling complex systems. Project members participated on implementation and enhancement of the most complex model of human physiology available free at [www.physiomodel.org](http://www.physiomodel.org). 

### What will be delivered at the end of the project?

We would like to release the book under creative commons licence. So the book will be available free of charge to anybody. We would like to release PDF, ebook and printed version of the book as well, but this will need additional costs, so we do not promise that the additional form of the book will be free.

### What will be timeframe of the project?

First beta release is planned to be until IEEE Engineering in Biology and Medicine Conference 2016, where a set of tutorials and workshops on Modeling Physiology is already done. First final release will be introduced also in Modelica conference in 2017.
