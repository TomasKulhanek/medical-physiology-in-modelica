Preface
=======

This book is being written for the people interested in mathematical models in the field of Medical Physiology. With our findings and years of experiences we have chosen the current Modelica standard language as it seems to best capture the essence of the modeled reality currently. However, the examples presented within this book could be implemented with more or less effort in any other modeling language. However, there might be some limitation as the Modelica language can differ with features which other languages miss.

While we have chosen the Modelica standard language, the details of general Modelica is covered by excelent published works by Peter Fritzson - "Principles of Object-Oriented Modeling and Simulation with Modelica 3.3: A Cyber-Physical Approach" and a free online book by Michael Tiller "Modelica by Example" available at [book.xogeny.com](http://book.xogeny.com).

The first release of this book is now trying to be supported by a crowdfunding campaign via indiegogo.


### Why we need support?

Well, we are group of scientists, students in the multidisciplinar field of medical physiology, computer science, numerical mathematics, computer designers. Among our duties is to teach students of biomedical engineering the modeling and simulation. Well, writing a book - handbook is not generally supported by scientific grants -- it's not so innovative. And well we need a support for couple of months to focus on this task. 

### Why so big ammount of money?

We need to support 4-5 people for several months (4-6).  Otherwise we will be asked to write unrelated articles to scientific journal with impact factor, or to work for other scientific groups who fortunately has some scientific grants, but not space for writing a book.

### Why a book of modeling medical physiology?

The Modelica language and standard is a niche in an area of industry modeling and design. Within medical sciences, the models are used to formalize mathematical knowledge, however, Modelica is not yet widely accepted and there exists several home-grown or community-grown domain specific languages, however, missing the strength of industrial standard and strength of several unique features.

### What will be delivered at the end of the project?

We would like to release the book under creative commons licence. So the book will be available freely to anyone with access to Internet. We would like to release PDF, ebook and printed version of the book, which we do not promise to be free. However, via gitbook.com it seems not to be additionally expensive.

### What will be timeframe of the project?

First beta release is planned to be until IEEE Engineering in Biology and Medicine Conference 2016, first fianl  release in Modelica conference very probably in 2017.
