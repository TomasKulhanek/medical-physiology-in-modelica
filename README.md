# Preface

This book is being written continuously. 

As this book is free, we need to support the first release of this book via various channels, 
we used in the past the following:
* via Indiegogo [igg.me/at/mephysmo](http://igg.me/at/mephysmo)
* via BitcoinUtopia [www.bitcoinutopia.com/2015/12/modelica/](http://www.bitcoinutopia.com/2015/12/modelica/)
Thank you for the supporters.

The content is based on our experience of teaching the modeling and simulation courses for students of biomedical engineering. We had made several decisions, which influense the methodology used further.
First decision is a modeling language and style. we had chosen the Modelica standard language as it is open, provides key features such as object oriented, equation-based, acausal. 
Object orientation allows to maintain complex models and still preserve basic understandability. 
The equation-based and acausal feature allows to focus on physical reality rather than on determining what is input and output in different cases and how to determine causality.

The details of general Modelica is covered by excellent published works by Peter Fritzson[^1] and a free online book by Michael Tiller[^2]. This book focus on features which we had faced during modeling selected areas of medical physiology.

### Who we are?

We are group of researchers, current or former students from various fields - medical physiology, computer science, numerical mathematics, graphic designers. Among others, the authors of this book are developing free libraries for Modelica language [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) (1st library award at Modelica conference 2014) and [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical)(1st library award at Modelica conference 2015). 

### Why we need a support?
If we will charge the book, it will be not broadly available for everyone who is interested. The support will give us freedom to fully focus on writing the book from the collected materials we already have. 

### Why so big ammount of money?

We need to support several people for several months (4-6) to fully focus on qualitative material preparation. Writing book, writing/revieweing examples, improving free Modelica libraries (  [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org), [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical)).

### Why a book of modeling medical physiology?

Modeling medical physiology is covered by another books, which however presumes strong mathematical background. Models expressed in Modelica can keep the mathematical exactness however still be understandable for other domain experts.

### What will be delivered at the end of the project?

We would like to release the book under creative commons licence. So the book will be available free of charge to anybody. We would like to release PDF, ebook and printed version of the book as well, but this will need additional costs, so we do not promise that the additional form of the book will be free. The book will contain many examples, which will encourage us to update and enhance the free libraries  [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) and [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical) too.


### What will be time-frame of the project?

Beta release is planned to be until IEEE Engineering in Biology and Medicine Conference 2016. Final release will be introduced also in Modelica conference in 2017.
