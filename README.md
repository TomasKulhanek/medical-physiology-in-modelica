Preface
=======

This book is intended to be read by people interested within their study, research or industrial interest related to modeling of Medical Physiology. For presenting implementation of mathematical models, we have chosen the Modelica standard language as it seems to best capture the essence of the modeled reality. However, the presented examples could be implemented with more or less effort in any other modeling languageith limitation on the specific feature of Modelica language, which however seems to be adopted in other modeling standards.

While we have chosen the Modelica standard language, the details of general Modelica is covered by other published works e.g. the comprehensive book by Peter Fritzson - "Principles of Object-Oriented Modeling and Simulation with Modelica 3.3: A Cyber-Physical Approach" or a free online book by Michael Tiller "Modelica by Example" available at [book.xogeny.com](http://book.xogeny.com).

The first release of this book tries to be supported by the crowdfunding campaign.
