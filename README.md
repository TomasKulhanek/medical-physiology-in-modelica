# Preface

This book is free. We need to support continuous development of this book via various channels, we used in the past the following:
* via Indiegogo [igg.me/at/mephysmo](http://igg.me/at/mephysmo)
* via BitcoinUtopia [www.bitcoinutopia.com/2015/12/modelica/](http://www.bitcoinutopia.com/2015/12/modelica/)
Thank you for the supporters.

This book is based on the materials used for research and education. The methodology used in this book is used to build and maintain complex model of human physiology www.physiomodel.org. The methodology is also used in training courses of modeling and simulation for students of biomedical engineering.

We had chosen the Modelica standard language. It is open, standardized, well maintained by academic and industry and provides key features such as object oriented, equation-based, acausality. The Acausality feature seems to be important for complex models, which helps to keep the understandability on higher level model structure and keep exactness on the lower level of the modeled reality.

The details of general Modelica is covered by excellent published works by Peter Fritzson[^1] and a free online book by Michael Tiller[^2]. This book focus on features which we had faced during modeling selected areas of medical physiology.

### Who we are?

We are group of researchers, former students from various fields - medical physiology, computer science, numerical mathematics, graphic designers. Authors of this book develop and maintain free libraries for Modelica language [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) (1st library award at Modelica conference 2014) and [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical)(1st library award at Modelica conference 2015). 

### Why we need a support?
If we will charge the book, it will be not broadly available for everyone who is interested. The support will give us freedom to fully focus on writing the book from the collected materials we already have. 

### Why so big ammount of money?

We need to support several people for several months (4-6) to fully focus on qualitative material preparation. Writing book, writing/revieweing examples, improving free Modelica libraries (  [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org), [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical)).

### Why a book of modeling medical physiology?

Mathematical modeling as well as modeling in Modelica language is covered by great books in references. Modeling medical physiology is covered by another sort of books, which however, presumes strong background in mathematical and physical sciences. Models expressed in Modelica can keep the mathematical exactness however still be understandable for other domain experts.

### What will be delivered at the end of the project?

We would like to release the book under creative commons licence. So the book will be available free of charge to anybody. We would like to release PDF, ebook and printed version of the book as well, but this will need additional costs, so we do not promise that the additional form of the book will be free. The book will contain many examples, which will encourage us to update and enhance the free libraries  [Physiolibrary](http://www.physiolibrary.org) and [Chemical](https://github.com/MarekMatejak/Chemical) too.


### What will be time-frame of the project?

Beta release is planned to be until IEEE Engineering in Biology and Medicine Conference 2016. Final release will be introduced also in Modelica conference in 2017.
